If any of these checks fail or if you're unsure about the output, you may need to reinstall wxWidgets or consult the documentation for the specific distribution you're using (in this case, Manjaro Linux) for further troubleshooting steps.

This README should cover installation instructions for wxWidgets on various operating systems, along with troubleshooting steps for Windows, macOS, other Linux distributions, and Manjaro Linux. Feel free to modify it further as needed for your project.
